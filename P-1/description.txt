Step 1: Create a Lambda Function
- Go to the Lambda Service in the AWS Management Console.
- Click Create Function.
- Select Author from Scratch.
- Enter a function name.
- Set the runtime to Node.js 20.
- Click Create Function to finish.

Step 2: Monitor Lambda Metrics
- After the function is created, navigate to your Lambda function.
- Select the Monitor tab, then click on the Metrics sub-tab.
- You will see metrics like Error Count and Success Rate (%).
- These metrics will allow us to set up an alarm that triggers when the error count exceeds a certain threshold.

Step 3: Create an SNS Topic for Notifications
- Navigate to the Simple Notification Service (SNS) in the AWS console.
- In the left panel, click Topics.
- Click Create Topic.
- Select Standard as the type of the topic.
- Enter a name for the topic.
- Click Create Topic.

Step 4: Subscribe to the SNS Topic
- After the topic is created, go to the Subscriptions tab for that topic.
- Click Create Subscription.
- In the Create Subscription section:
  ❖ Select Email as the protocol.
  ❖ Enter your email address where you want to receive notifications.
- Click Create Subscription.
- The status of the subscription will be Pending. Go to your email and confirm the subscription.
- After confirmation, the status will change to Confirmed.

Step 5: Test the Lambda Function
- Return to your Lambda function, and go to the Code tab.
- Click the dropdown next to the Test button, then select Configure Test Event.
  ❖ Enter an event name.
  ❖ Click Save.
- Click Test to execute your Lambda function.
- Note: The error metrics may take some time to reflect in the Monitor tab.

Step 6: Create a CloudWatch Alarm
- Go to the CloudWatch service in the AWS console.
- Click Create Alarm.
- Click Select Metrics.
- In the Metrics section, select Lambda Metrics.
- Choose the By Function Name option.
- Select your Lambda function, and choose the Errors metric.
- Click Select Metric.
- In the Specify Metric and Conditions section:
  - In the Statistics field, change the default Average to Maximum.
  - In the Conditions section, set the threshold type to Static.
  - Under Whenever Error Count is, select Greater Than or Equal to.
  - Set the value to 1.

Step 7: Set Up Notifications for the Alarm
- In the Notifications section, set the Alarm State Trigger to In Alarm.
- Under Send a Notification to, select Existing SNS Topic.
- Choose the SNS topic you created earlier.
- The email endpoint you provided will appear in the notification settings.
- Click Next.

Step 8: Name and Create the Alarm
- Enter a name for your alarm.
- Click Next, then Create Alarm.

Step 9: Trigger the Alarm with a Lambda Error
- Go back to your Lambda function.
- Introduce an intentional error in the code (for example, change JSON to JON).
- Click Deploy to save your changes.
- Click Test 4 to 5 times to invoke the function and produce errors.

Step 10: Verify the CloudWatch Alarm
- Go back to the CloudWatch service.
- Check the state of your alarm, which will be set to In Alarm if errors were detected.

Step 11: Receive SNS Email Notification
- Once the alarm state changes to In Alarm, you should receive an email notification at the email address you provided during the SNS subscription setup.
