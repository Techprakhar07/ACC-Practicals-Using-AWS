Step 1: Create a KMS Key
- Navigate to the KMS service in the AWS Management Console.
- Click Create Key and select the key type (e.g., Symmetric).
- Configure key policies and access permissions.
- Finish the key creation and take note of the key ARN.

Step 2: Enable Encryption for the S3 Bucket
- Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
- Select the bucket and go to the Properties tab.
- Under Default Encryption, choose AWS-KMS and select the key created in Step 1.
- Save changes to enable bucket encryption.

Step 3: Upload Data to the Bucket
- Upload files to the S3 bucket to ensure that they are encrypted using the specified KMS key.
- Check the encryption status by viewing object properties.

Step 4: Verify Data Encryption
- Use the AWS CLI or SDK to list bucket objects and confirm the encryption:
  aws s3api head-object --bucket <bucket-name> --key <file-key>
- Ensure that the `ServerSideEncryption` field shows `aws:kms`.
