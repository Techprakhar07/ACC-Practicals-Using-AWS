Step 1: Create a Custom IAM Policy
- Go to the IAM service in the AWS Console.
- Click Policies > Create Policy.
- Use the JSON editor to define the policy with specific permissions, such as:
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "s3:*",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"
      }
    ]
  }
- Review and create the policy.

Step 2: Create an IAM Role and Attach the Policy
- Navigate to IAM > Roles > Create Role.
- Choose the trusted entity type (e.g., EC2).
- Attach the custom policy created in Step 1.
- Complete the role creation.

Step 3: Attach the IAM Role to an EC2 Instance
- Go to the EC2 service in the AWS Console.
- Select the EC2 instance and attach the role created in Step 2.

Step 4: Test S3 Access
- SSH into the EC2 instance and run the command:
  aws s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>
- Verify that the instance has access as per the custom policy.
