Step 1: Create a CloudFront Distribution
- Go to the CloudFront service in the AWS Management Console.
- Click Create Distribution and choose Web as the delivery method.
- Configure the origin settings and select the S3 bucket as the source.
- Set up caching and distribution settings (e.g., default root object, custom error pages).

Step 2: Configure Security Settings
- Navigate to the CloudFront distribution and select the Behaviors tab.
- Configure access permissions (e.g., Restrict Viewer Access).
- Enable signed URLs and set expiration times for restricted access.

Step 3: Test Image Access
- Copy the CloudFront distribution URL and access images using the URL.
- Ensure that access control is working as expected and images are served securely.

Step 4: Verify Distribution
- Use the AWS CLI to check the status of the distribution and confirm successful deployment.
  aws cloudfront get-distribution --id <distribution-id>
