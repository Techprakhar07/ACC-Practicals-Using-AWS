# Practical 03: AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) for Sending Messages

## Objective
This practical covers the implementation of AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) to send and receive messages between components of a distributed system, allowing asynchronous communication.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand how to create and manage an SQS queue.
- Learn how to send and receive messages programmatically.
- Integrate SQS with EC2 instances and other services for event-driven architectures.

## Key AWS Services Used
- **AWS SQS**: A fully managed message queuing service.
- **AWS EC2**: Virtual server instances to run applications.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with permissions to create and manage SQS queues and EC2 instances.
- Basic knowledge of message queuing and event-driven architecture.

## Practical Steps Overview
1. Create an SQS queue.
2. Send messages to the SQS queue using a script.
3. Receive messages from the SQS queue using an EC2 instance.
4. Verify message processing and deletion.
