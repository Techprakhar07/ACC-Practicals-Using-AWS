Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
- Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
- Click Create Bucket and configure the bucket settings.
- Upload a sample file to the bucket.

Step 2: Create an IAM Role
- Go to the IAM service in the AWS Console.
- Click Roles > Create Role.
- Choose AWS service as the trusted entity and select EC2.
- Attach the policy that grants S3 read/write access (e.g., AmazonS3FullAccess).
- Review and create the role.

Step 3: Attach the IAM Role to an EC2 Instance
- Go to the EC2 service in the AWS Console.
- Select an existing EC2 instance or launch a new one.
- Attach the IAM role created in Step 2 to the instance.

Step 4: Verify S3 Access from EC2
- SSH into the EC2 instance and use the AWS CLI to list S3 bucket contents:
  aws s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>
- Verify that the EC2 instance can read or write to the bucket based on the assigned policy.
