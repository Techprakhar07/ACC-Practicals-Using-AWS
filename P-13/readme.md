# Practical 13: Configuring Layered Security in an AWS VPC (NACL)

## Objective
Learn how to configure Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) in an AWS VPC to enforce layered security by controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand how to set up and configure NACLs for enhanced security.
- Learn to define inbound and outbound rules for controlling traffic.
- Apply best practices for network security in an AWS environment.

## Key AWS Services Used
- **Amazon VPC**: Virtual private cloud service.
- **Network ACLs**: Access control lists for subnet-level security.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with permissions to manage VPCs and NACLs.
- Basic knowledge of VPC subnets, routing, and security.

## Practical Steps Overview
1. Create a VPC with public and private subnets.
2. Set up a default NACL and customize rules for traffic control.
3. Test inbound and outbound rules with traffic simulation.
4. Monitor network traffic and verify NACL configurations.
