Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
- Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
- Click Create Bucket and configure the bucket settings.
- Ensure the bucket is in the same region as the RDS instance for data transfer.

Step 2: Grant Permissions for S3 Access
- Go to the IAM service in the AWS Console.
- Create an IAM policy with permissions to write to the S3 bucket:
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "s3:PutObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"
      }
    ]
  }
- Attach this policy to the IAM role used by the RDS instance.

Step 3: Export the RDS Snapshot to S3
- Navigate to the RDS service in the AWS Console.
- Select the RDS snapshot and click Export to S3.
- Choose the S3 bucket created in Step 1.
- Configure export settings and start the export process.

Step 4: Verify the Exported Data
- Go to the S3 bucket and check for the exported data.
- Verify the data structure and content to ensure successful export.
